More and more companies are transitioning away from a strict tier-based operations model. In these companies, developers and infrastructure engineers **respond to alerts directly**, instead of a tier-1 team. This shortcuts the traditional manual-escalation process and reduces over all resolution time significantly.

On Call Management tools enable this new methodology. They consume alerts from your monitoring stack, and **route the alerts automatically** to the person who is currently on call. The alert is normally communicated to the on-call person via a mobile notification. If the person doesn't respond within the requirements of a pre-defined SLA, the alert is **automatically escalated** to a second on-call person.
