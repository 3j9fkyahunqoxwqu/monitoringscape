The past decade has seen a dramatic shift in how we build applications: clouds, containers and micro-services have displaced the old paradigm of static, monolithic infrastructure.  The need for operational visibility has grown tenfold.  Thankfully, the monitoring landscape has kept up with the times.

We now have a choice of over 100 monitoring tools that provide excellent visibility to every nook and cranny of our IT stack.  The modern monitoring landscape has something for everyone: on-prem installations, SaaS applications, open-source tools and high-priced enterprise monitoring suites.  However, with so many tools to choose from, the monitoring landscape can be difficult to navigate.

MonitoringScape is your guide to the new, exciting world of modern monitoring.  Keep in mind that this is a community resource, so your comments and suggestions are very welcome.
