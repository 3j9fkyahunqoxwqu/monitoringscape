Mobile apps include large quantities of native code whose performance is **directly tied to revenue**. And yet too often operations teams dismiss the importance of the reliability of native code, perhaps due to the fact that it resides outside of the datacenter. In fact, we should monitor our mobile apps with the same level of diligence given to backend infrastructure.

Mobile APMs are embedded into mobile apps and provide real-time visibility on their performance. Use them to **track crashes** and **measure app speed**. Debug issues by segmenting them according to device, operating system or geography.


## Common Features
* Crash reports
* Impact analysis of external services
* Client-backend communication monitoring
* Device, os, carrier network & geo segmentation
