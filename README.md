This repository contains the source code to the [MonitoringScape](http://www.bigpanda.io/monitoringscape) project, maintained by [BigPanda](http://www.bigpanda.io) and community contributors.

### Introduction
The past ten years have seen a drastic shift in how we build applications: clouds, containers and micro-services displaced the old paradigm of static, monolithic infrastructure. The need for operational visibility has grown tenfold. Thankfully, the monitoring stack kept up with the times.

We now have a choice of more than 100 monitoring tools allowing for excellent visibility of the entire stack. The modern monitoring landscape has something for everyone: on-prem installations, SaaS applications, open-source tools and high-priced enterprise monitoring suites.
